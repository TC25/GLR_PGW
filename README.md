# GLR_PGW
 
Summaries of pseudo global warming simulations over the Great Lakes Region. Specifics below:

# Data
Each CSV file provides regional summaries from PGW simulations, either over land, for urban grids, or rural grids. This includes cumulative hours above critical heat stress threholds as well as their population-adjusted values. 

The 'Future_sensitivities_land.csv' file calculates heat stress in the future by keeping all variables except one the same value as the historical run. 


See Chakraborty et al. Under Review for more details.
